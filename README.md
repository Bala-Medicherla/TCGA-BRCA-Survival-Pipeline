# Survival analysis
A reproducible R project exploring survival analysis and machine learning for time-to-event clinical outcomes using simulated data.

**Project overview** :
 1. This project explores how time to event clinical outcomes can be analyzed using both traditional survival analysis techniques and machine learning–based methods.
 2. I developed this project as part of my preparation for PhD applications in Biomedical / Health Informatics, with the goal of demonstrating practical skills in clinical data modeling, statistical reasoning, and reproducible research.
 3. The analysis focuses on a simulated clinical dataset and compares classical survival models with more flexible machine learning approaches to understand treatment effects and patient risk.
